# Green Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
Steve's parents want to invest their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation. Instead of putting all of their money into one company, Steve wants to analyze 12 green energy stock companies based on how actively the stock is traded and its yearly return. He has given me an Excel containing the stock data and I will be using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to build a macro to analyze all the data in a click of a button.
### Purpose
The purpose is to use VBA to build a macro that will analyze data for the entire stock market in 2017 and 2018. A macro was created with a SubRoutine, Range and For Loops to analyze all the stock data. After analyzing the stocks, the macro was refactored to run more efficiently in less amount of time.
##Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
The analysis revealed that more stocks were traded and there was a higher rate of yearly return for each company in 2017 than 2018. First, let's take a look at the company Steve's parents wanted to invest all of their money into, DQ. DQ went from a return rate of 199.4% in 2017 to a -62.6% in 2018. Two companies that did exceptionally well in 2018 with a return rate of 81.9% was ENPH and a return rate of 84.0% was RUN.

##Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
#What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
